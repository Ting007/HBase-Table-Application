Use HBase Java API to create an HBase table named “pts”, and load both datasets p2.csv and p3.csv into this table. Harmonize coding inconsistencies before loading them into the HBase table (the harmonization needs to be included in your code as well). When loading the two datasets to the “pts” table, please create three column families “demographics”, “anthropometry”, and “medical_history”. <br />

After the datasets are successfully loaded, count the numbers of female and male patients in the “pts” table, respectively.<br />

Find the patient records with missing values for asthma, and update the missing values as 8 (i.e., using 8 to represent unknown or missing).<br />
